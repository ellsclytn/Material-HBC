# Material-HBC
### A minimal, material design inspired theme for the Wii Homebrew Channel
**Author: Ellis Clayton**
**Version: 1.1**
**Last release date: 24/01/2015**

----------


##Installation
1. Compress the contents of "dist/theme" into theme.zip. 
2. Place your newly created "theme.zip" along with "dist/meta.xml" and "dist/icon.png" into a single folder, with a name of your choice (I'd recommend something along the lines of "Material-HBC").
3. Place the folder into the apps directory on your SD card, and install the theme like any other HBC application.

##Uninstallation
Currently, the only known way to revert to the default theme is to remove the HBC save file on the Wii. This will also remove any custom preferences for the HBC. 

It is also possible to install another theme, as this will overwrite the previously installed theme.
